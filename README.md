# 🧠 Vision Transformer (ViT) – Image Classification

This project implements an **image classification system** using the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** architecture. It demonstrates the power of transformer-based models in computer vision, offering competitive performance compared to traditional CNNs.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Vision Transformer (ViT) applies the Transformer architecture directly to image patches, without relying on convolutions. In this project, the model is trained and evaluated on a benchmark dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10 or similar) for multi-class image classification.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook or any IDE  

---


---

## 🧪 Dataset

- The model supports datasets like **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, or **custom image folders**.
- Images are resized into fixed-size patches before being processed by the transformer.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Patch embedding and positional encoding
- Multi-head self-attention mechanism
- MLP head for classification
- Configurable ViT architecture (patch size, hidden dim, depth, etc.)
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualization
